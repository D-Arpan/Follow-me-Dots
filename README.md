# Follow Me Dots 🎯

A fun project where glowing dots follow your mouse cursor.  
Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to practice DOM manipulation and event handling.  

---

## 🎮 Demo
Move your mouse around the screen and watch the dots chase it with smooth trailing effects.  
- Hover over a dot → it turns **red**  
- Move the cursor → dots follow with different speeds  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML** – page structure  
- **CSS** – styling & transitions  
- **JavaScript** – interactivity (mousemove events, hover effects)
